# Oximage

Oximage is a image organizer, made with :heart: in Rust

It will be optimized for batch rendering and multithreading, using Rust 
memory safety constructions as an advantage.

For now, it will be a CLI-only editor, but we want to add an interface on top of it

## Planned features

* [ ] Graphical interface

# Oximage

[![Travis status](https://api.travis-ci.org/arthurmco/oxImage.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/arthurmco/oxImage)

Oximage is a image organizer, made with :heart: in Rust (making things with :heart: is so 
trending these days :D )

It will be optimized for batch editing and multithreading, using Rust 
memory safety constructions as an advantage.

It will feature a gallery which you can choose the photos you want to edit, and edit 
it graphically. It will let you edit one photo or make an operation in several photos, 
such as resizing, color correction, watermark, and so on...

For now, it will be a CLI-only editor, but we want to add an interface on top of it

## Planned features

* [ ] Graphical interface
* [ ] Tagging system
* [ ] Possibility of upload images on external services
* [ ] Basic editing features

If you can contribute in those features, please do so.

I never programmed seriously in Rust before, so if you can help cleaning the code and converting it to correct Rust code, I'd appreciate it.

# Oximage

Oximage is a image organizer, made with :heart: in Rust

It will be optimized for batch editing and multithreading, using Rust 
memory safety constructions as an advantage.

It will feature a gallery which you can choose the photos you want to edit, and edit 
it graphically. It will let you edit one photo or make an operation in several photos, 
such as resizing, color correction, watermark, and so on...

For now, it will be a CLI-only editor, but we want to add an interface on top of it

## Planned features

* [ ] Graphical interface
* [ ] Tagging system
* [ ] Possibility of upload
